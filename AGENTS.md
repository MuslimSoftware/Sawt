# Sawt Project Description
Sawt is a demo project demonstrating a DIY voice agent. The front end displays a circle that's size matches the current volume level either coming from the user themselves speaking into their mic or the backend streaming the agent's voice (via TTS)

When making changes to the logic in any of the directories, please update the corresponding `AGENTS.md` file to reflect these changes.
